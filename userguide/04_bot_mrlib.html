      	<h2>Using Bot mrLib Library</h2>
      	<p>
      		MR-FWNS contains a library called bot_mrlib to use basic fucntions to calculate positions and generating simple movements.
      		The library could be used to implement basic AI behaviour such as getting middle of a goal, moving towards a specific point on the field and so on.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		To use the library simply include the file <i>bot_mrlib.jar</i> into your project.
      		The library includes several classes with static functions you can use.
      		Every class represents a different problem type that the included function are solving. 
      	</p>
      	
      	<h4>mrlib.core.FellowPlayers</h4>
      	<p>
      		This is an enum to define different types of player on the field.
      		A player could be an <code>TeamMate</code>, <code>Opponent</code>.
      		The enum is used to search for different types of players.
      	</p>
      	
      	<h4>mrlib.core.KickLib</h4>
      	<p>
      		Contains several functions to generate a kick action.
      		Mainly used to kick to a <code>ReferencePoint</code>, <code>FellowPlayer</code> or into a specific direction.
      		The class could also be used to kick to the nearest player.
      	</p>
      	
      	<h4>mrlib.core.MoveLib</h4>
      	<p>
      		The <code>MoveLib</code> class contains functions to generate movement actions.
      		For example running or turning around to a <code>BallPosition</code> or <code>ReferencePoint</code>.
      		It also includes three public static attributes to influence movement behaviour.
      		Refer to corresponding section in userguide for more details.
      	</p>
      	
      	<h4>mrlib.core.PlayersLib</h4>
      	<p>
      		This class offers functions to get lists if several types of players or checking dependencies with other players.
      		For example calculating if an enemy is around the bot or getting the distance between two players. 
      	</p>
      	
      	<h4>mrlib.core.PositionLib</h4>
      	<p>
      		The PositionLib includes function to calculate different positions like the middle of a goal or to check if a
      		<code>BallPosition</code> is in a range around an <code>ReferencePoint</code>.
